## The HTML model can be simply divided into two parts:
**Token-Level Transformer and Sentence-Level Transformer.**

For the token-level transformer, there are several ways to load the pre-trained transformers and encode you inputs. 
We put two options here: 1) Bert-as-a-service 2)Hugging Face Transformers.

For the sentence-level transformer, we provide a customized lightweight transformer that can be easily adapt to either classification or regression problems.
