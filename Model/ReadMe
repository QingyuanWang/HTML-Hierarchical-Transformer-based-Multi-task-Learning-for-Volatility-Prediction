The HTML model can be simply divided into two parts:
Token-Level Transformer and Sentence-Level Transformer.

For the token-level transformer, there are several ways to load and encode you inputs. 
We put two options here: 1) Bert-as-a-service 2)Hugging Face Transformers.

For the sentence-level transformer, we design a customized lightweight transformer that can be easily adapt to either classification ot regression problem.
